file handling concept in c++
1> program to file  write operation
2> file to program read operation
        
                 stream based input output
   stream are data bytes. Data channel going and outing.
   1> input stream = flow of data device to memory  (cin)
   2> input stream = flow of data memory to device  (cout)
 major class is ios class lies in top hierarchy
  its type:
  1) istream and ostream
  in istream : ifstream = This data type represents the input file stream and is used to read information from files.
  in ostream : ofstream = This data type represents the output file stream and is used to create files and to write information to files.
  
  fstream:
This class is the combination of both ofstream and ifstream. It provides the capability of creating, writing
and reading a file. To access the following classes, you must include the fstream as a header file like how we
declare iostream in the header.
 
  fstream
  This data type represents the file stream generally, and has the capabilities of
  both ofstream and ifstream which means it can create files,
  write information to files, and read information from files.

  formatted and unformatted
  formatted : includes format specifier    (printf,scanf)
  unformatted : excludes format specifier  (cin,cout)

   create a file
   open a file
   read from a file
   write a file
   close a file

   File Operations in C++
C++ provides us with four different operations for file handling. They are:
  

open() – This is used to create a file.  syntax> objectname.open( FileName , Mode );
                                         ios::in (File opened in reading mode)
read()  – This is used to read the data from the file.
write() – This is used to write new data to file.  syntax> FileName<<"Insert the text here";
                                                   ios::out (File opened in write mode)

 close() – This is used to close the file.  syntax> objectname.close()        

 get()	Read a single character from a file

 put()	write a single character in file.
 
 while(1) -> infinity
